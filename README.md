# Diabetes Classification

## Overview
Diabetes is a chronic disease affecting millions in the U.S., posing significant health risks and economic burdens. Early diagnosis through predictive modeling is essential for effective management.

## Dataset
The dataset `diabetes_binary_classification_data.csv` contains 253,680 responses from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

- **Target Variable**: `Diabetes_binary`
  - `0`: No diabetes
  - `1`: Prediabetes or diabetes
- **Features**: 21 variables based on health behaviors and conditions (imbalanced dataset).

## Research Questions
1. Can survey data predict diabetes presence accurately?
2. What risk factors are most predictive of diabetes?
3. Can a subset of features effectively predict diabetes?
4. Which machine learning models perform best in classification?

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset.
- **Visualization**: Analyze data distribution and correlations.
- **Modeling**: Use three machine learning models (excluding deep learning) for classification.
